# Antonio Ugalde's Partfolio

I am a computer engineer at CSUF 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 1

   This was one of my favorite labs because I got a great partner for it, and it was fun and engaging to code. One of the main things we used in Lab 6 was strings and command lines to build a sandwich. This 
  was very fun and easy to code and debug.

* Lab 7, part 1

   This was another of my favorite labs this semester because we used strings and vectors, which are used a lot in other labs. I also had a great time with my partner coding and figuring out the solutions to 
  this Lab. We had to code the times between certain parking times and ensure it worked. This Lab was one the easiest as well.

* Lab 3, part 2
  
   This was the most interesting Lab for me. It wasn't easy, but my partner and I eventually did what we could. In this part of Lab 3, we had to find Julian's day using the month, day, and year.Â  Although 
  this Lab was difficult, I learned a lot of basics. In this Lab, we learned how to implement math and input numbers.
